### Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app and why it needs solving.

Compared to America there are little to none sneaker reselling marketplaces present in Australia. For those sneakerheads living in Australia wanting to purchase a pair of premium sneakers that aren't available in Australia are more than likely to go the extra yard and purchase sneakers overseas and along with that a large sum in international shipping fees. With the Australian exchange rate plummeting at an all time low purchasing a pair of sneakers in America can be a bit overwhelming and financially difficult.

#### Purpose
Knowing that products are now domestically available users can easily browse and sell sneakers and see what's available on the website. Creating a consumer-to-consumer(C2C) marketplace app will hopefully build a strong presence amongst sneakerhead communities in Australia.
