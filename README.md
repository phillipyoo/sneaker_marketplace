### Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app and why it needs solving.

Compared to America there are little to none sneaker reselling marketplaces present in Australia. For those sneakerheads living in Australia wanting to purchase a pair of premium sneakers that aren't available in Australia are more than likely to go the extra yard and purchase sneakers overseas and along with that a large sum in international shipping fees. With the Australian exchange rate plummeting at an all time low purchasing a pair of sneakers in America can be a bit overwhelming and financially difficult.

#### Purpose
Knowing that products are now available Australian sneakerheads can easily browse and sell sneakers and see what's available on the website. Creating a consumer-to-consumer(C2C) marketplace app will hopefully build a strong presence amongst sneakerhead communities in Australia.

#### Features

1. Users will be able to browse the latest sneakers that have been posted online by seller themselves. However buyers can only add an item once they have registered an account.  
2. Users can upload a pair of sneakers they are willing to sell by filling up a form requiring details about the shoe itself before uploading it onto the market
3. Registered users can go into their account and check their wishlist whenever they'd like to revisit an item. Sellers can also do somethng similar by going into account and checking their sneaker posts in listings. 
4. If a buyer would like to enquire about a pair of kicks they can send a message to the seller through an internal user messaging system.
5. Admin user is capable of overlooking all registered users and can choose to block a user if they turn out to be a scammer or caught selling fakes.
